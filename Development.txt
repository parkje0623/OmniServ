React Development:
 1. Home Page
 2. Top Header Bar
 3. Side Bar
    - Title (div - center tetxt)
    - Sections (div)
        - Icon (left-align)
        - Text in <h4> (right-align)


React Learning
 1. Layout (Component) - Important in SPA (single-page application)
    - Use Layout Component for Uniform Structure (like Sidebar, Header)
 2. NavLink - Links to Navigate Between the Pages and Apply isActive className
 3. BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route
    - BrowserRouter as Router: 
        -> Component, top-level wrapper for your routing configuration
        -> Enables the use of the browser's History API to handle routing
    - Routes:
        -> Component, It acts as a container for all Route components
    - Route:
        -> Component, where you define a specific path and the component that should be rendered when the user navigates to that path
 4. useEffect vs. useCallback vs. useMemo
    - useEffect: Run side-effects in functional component
        -> Fetching data
        -> Running code in response to specific state/prop changes
    - useCallback: Memoize a function, only re-created if dependencies change
        -> Passing stable callback functions (onClick, onChange, etc.)
        -> Avoiding re-renders (when component receives the same function reference)
    - useMemo: Memoize a computed value, only re-calcaulted if dependencies change
        -> Expensive Calculation
        -> Optimizing derived data


CSS Learning
 1. rem (root em) vs px (absolute unit)
    - Use 'px' if you want the size of the element/font to be fixed
    - Use 'rem' if you want to create flexible and responsive design layouts
 2. @media (min-width: 1440px) { ... }
    - If the browser's width is greater than or equal to 1440px, apply CSS inside the brackets.
 3. linear-gradient()
    - Creating Linear Gradient CSS styling
    - linear-gradient(DIRECTION, COLOR_STOP1, COLOR_STOP2, ...)
    - E.g., linear-gradient(to right, 'red' 0%, 'blue' 50%, 'red' 100%);
        -> From left to right, color is red at start, transitioning to blue at the middle, back to red at the end
